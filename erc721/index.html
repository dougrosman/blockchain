    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dealing with time + Eth. How to trigger events?</strong> Chronologic? Ethereum Alarm Clock? On-chain solutions seem tricky at the moment. Offchain, while also complex, seems like a known quantity. IE, host a dapp somewhere (glitch) with a simple javascript function that calls a read-only function from the smart contract once per day. If certain conditions are met, initiate a transaction.</li>
        <li><strong>(ERC-20) How to automate transactions without needing Metamask approval?</strong> Use the transferFrom function, which requires pre-approval of funds. This could get around that. How to streamline approval in the mint process...</li>
        <li><strong>How to use the posession of an ERC721 to grant permission to users.</strong> Check that a user owns a specific ERC-721 (also check if they have a certain balance of them). If they satisfy those conditions, then there are extra things they can do (like approve people for transactions)</li>
