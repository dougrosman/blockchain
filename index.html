                <h6>(Last Update: 09/20/2020)</h6>
                <p>This is a living document. At least, while it's alive, anyway. I'm creating this page for a couple reasons. It's mostly a personal project; a place to consolidate and sort and chronicle my own understanding of blockchains and their place in art and the world at large. But I also wanted to make this public so that others may benefit from my attempt to make this all make sense. This isn't an end-all resource for art and the blockchain; it's just another node that points back to all the other repositories of information cited within.</p>
                <p>Disparate sources have shaped my understanding of this wacky crypto world:  essays, articles, books, explanatory YouTube videos with nice motion graphics, live streams, Twitter Threads, Reddit posts, memes, webcomics, documentaries, university lectures, science fiction (short stories and novels), conversations, artist talks, interviews, panels, podcasts, white papers, TV shows. In alignment with the source material, it's been a very decentralized education.</p>
                <p>My hope is to thread this all together in a way that provides a bit more of a coherent narrative structure than the blockchain FAQs you'll find in the wild. The structure of a traditional, linear, written breakdown can hardly do justice to the non-linear approach one takes to understanding this complex, multidisciplinary topic. But it'll have to do.</p>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Where do we begin? Maybe with the question:</p>
                <p><em>What do I need to understand about blockchain to understand blockchain?</em></p>
                <p>In the general field of "Art and Technology" or "Computing and the Arts", we—artists and audience members alike—constantly face the problem of <em>needing</em> to understand the technology used in the work. For artists, we have to understand the technology enough to properly deconstruct it, subvert it, critique it, and create with/about it. We then have to be able to "forget" about all that technical minutae we painstakingly absorbed, and distill the parts that transcend those nuts and bolts into an art work that (hopefully) can offer an entry point to anyone. If blockchains are poised to revolutionize the world for everyone involved, shouldn't art about blockchains also be accessible to everyone without prior, esoteric knowledge of cryptography, networks and economics?</p>
                <p>I think the answer is yes. But I think that's very difficult to do. Of course, not every work has to be accessible or understood by everyone. But I think there the problems facing blockchain-adjacent art are the same problems that blockchain and "crypto" face in general: this technology is overly complex, and yet at a certain level should be understood by everyone.</p>
                <p>Comparisons to the Internet are inevitable. But consider the Internet, and the Web. For all the billions of people who use the Internet, how many know about things like IP addresses, DNS, TCP/IP, and all the other infrastructure? In the end, it turns out it doesn't matter that we don't know about these things. We can still use the Internet fine 95% of the time. Companies have spent decades refining interfaces to obscure the ugly technical side of things in order to deliver a smooth, seamless, human-centered experience.</p>
                <p>When asked why Bitcoin hasn't reached mass adoption, or why people haven't migrated off of Facebook to more trustworthy decentralized social media platforms, the answer is always the same: it's just not easy enough to use yet. Acquiring cryptocurrency, keeping track of wallets, adding a browser plugin that enables you to access web 3.0; all of this is inconvenient, and sparks too many questions along the way for your average user to want to deal with. If you can't beat Visa for your payments (just swipe the card for an instant transaction, and pay the bill at the end of the month), then you aren't going to get people switching to a new platform, no matter how "utopian" it might inevitably be.</p>
                <p>So at some point, someone will find a way to make the nuances of cryptocurrency invisible to your everyday user. People can still use it without understanding it in the same way we don't need to understand the HTML or http to use the Web. But the interesting thing about crypto, is that it's libertarian roots seem to ask more of the user. "Not your keys, not your crypto" they say. With crypto, you are responsible for your crypto, and that responsibility necessitates a deeper understanding of the thing. But then again, maybe that doesn't have to go much further than just knowing that we need to keep our private keys safe. We're already used to creating passwords for all our logins.</p>
                <p>I bring all this up, because the question of "where to begin" is complicated by this feeling that we need to understand so much more before we even beging talking about blockchains themselves. How much do we need to know about money and economics, about cryptography, about politics and ideologies? Unfortunately, I think the answer is, unfortunately, "more than we likely already do." Blockchain as a technology is deceptively simple: it's a distributed ledger that permanently records every transaction for all time, and it can't be tampered with. So if that's all it is, then the conversation becomes about the systems that surround this technology.</p>
