                <p>This is a living document. At least, while it's alive, anyway. I'm creating this page for a couple reasons. It's mostly a personal project; a place to consolidate and sort and chronicle my own understanding of blockchains and their place in art and the world at large. But I also wanted to make this public so that others may benefit from my attempt to make this all make sense. This isn't an end-all resource for art and the blockchain; it's just another node that points back to all the other repositories of information cited within.</p>
                <p>Many disparate sources have shaped my understanding of this wacky crypto world:  essays, articles, books, explanatory YouTube videos with nice motion graphics, live streams, Twitter Threads, Reddit posts, memes, webcomics, documentaries, university lectures, science fiction (short stories and novels), conversations, artist talks, interviews, panels, podcasts, white papers, TV shows. In alignment with the source material, it's been a very decentralized education.</p>
                <p>My hope is to thread this all together in a way that provides a bit more of a coherent narrative structure than the blockchain FAQs you'll find in the wild. The structure of a traditional, linear, written breakdown can hardly do justice to the non-linear approach one takes to understanding this complex, multidisciplinary topic. But it'll have to do.</p>
