    <p><em>Token Art Tokens (TARTs) are unique works of digital art, purchasable on the Ethereum blockchain. Each TART is simultaneously a work of art, as well as a tool to create works of art. With nearly 90 quadrillion unique TARTs available to own, their artistic potential is virtually limitless.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Token Art Token</em> explores ideas of art and aesthetic value, and how digital ownership through blockchain might accelerate art's hyper-commodification.</p>
